Challenge 10
===========

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

Write a class in **challenge_10.js** named "**SummationOfPrimes**" that accepts a single argument **limit**,  
where **limit** is the upper limit of prime numbers to find.  
Write an instance method named "**findSumOfPrimes**" that returns the **sum** of all prime numbers up to **limit**.

There are **0** tests, write one test to show the sum of all prime numbers under 2 million.  

(you'll need jasmine-node)

    npm install jasmine-node -g

run automated tests by running

    jasmine-node --autotest .
